Thank you teachers for be patient in teaching us, imparting valuable knowledge to us each and every single day. 
We truly do appreciate all that you have done on our behalf, all of the time you have spent passionately nurturing and educating us; all of the effort that you had to put in to prepare us for tests and even future events in life.
For that, I am sure that we will always be eternally grateful to all of you and we *will* make sure that all the time you spent on us wil not be wasted. We will work hard, ensure to complete every single one of tasks with the passion and knowledge that you have bestowed upon us.
Even when we grow older, as we move on into adulthood and into our future, I am certain that we will still say the same thing to all of you, the people who have helped us get here in our lives - Thank You.
